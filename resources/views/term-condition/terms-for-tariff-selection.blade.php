                    <h5>1. Tariff Selection</h5>
                    <p>
                        By selecting a tariff, you agree to the pricing, features, and limits described at the time of purchase.
                        Each tariff applies only to the event or account under which it was purchased.
                    </p>

                    <h5>2. Payment</h5>
                    <p>
                        All fees are due immediately upon selecting a tariff and completing the payment process.
                        Payments are non-refundable except where required by law.
                    </p>

                    <h5>3. Service Limits</h5>
                    <p>
                        Each tariff specifies the maximum number of voters or participants allowed.
                        Exceeding these limits may result in additional charges or restricted access.
                    </p>

                    <h5>4. Features</h5>
                    <p>
                        The features listed under each tariff (e.g., event creation, link generation, CSV export) are guaranteed
                        only for the duration of the selected tariff. Additional services not included in the tariff may incur extra fees.
                    </p>

                    <h5>5. Responsibility of Use</h5>
                    <p>
                        You are responsible for ensuring that your use of the service complies with local laws and regulations.
                        Misuse of the service (e.g., fraudulent events, spam) may lead to suspension without refund.
                    </p>

                    <h5>6. Modifications</h5>
                    <p>
                        We reserve the right to modify tariff prices and features, but such changes will not affect tariffs already purchased.

                    </p>

                    <h5>8. Governing Law</h5>
